# Prerelease Command Workflow
#
# This workflow is triggered by the /prerelease slash command on a PR.
# It builds and publishes a prerelease version of the package to PyPI.
#
# Usage: Comment `/prerelease` on a PR to trigger this workflow.
#
# Fork Support: This workflow supports PRs from forks by using refs/pull/<PR>/head
# which GitHub creates for all PRs regardless of fork status.
#
# Security: The slash-command-dispatch.yml restricts /prerelease to users with
# write permission, preventing untrusted users from publishing prereleases.
#
# Requirements:
# - GitHub App with workflow dispatch permissions (OCTAVIA_BOT_APP_ID and OCTAVIA_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY secrets)
# - PyPI Trusted Publisher configured for this workflow (see publish.yml header for setup)
